Input fileNum [, rec n]: list

recNum is used for random access files only
each input reads an entire record and remaining fields are ignored unless the list ends with a comma
if there are more fields in the list than values in the record, an additional record is read
display fields are separated by commas
internal fields will use csv for input
random access files start with record 0, if no rec specified, read next line
random access, if rec num specified, ignore previous ending comma


EOF(fileNum) function
test eof prior to reading data
file number not preceded by number sign
eof function does not work with random access files - create and end record to mark end of file
return values:
0 - not eof
+1 - logical eof - last record read
-1 - physical eof - out of disk space


Print fileNum [, rec n]: list
display type files must have comma separators if the data will later be read by TI Basic
if display type data exceeds record length, a new record will be written
internal type data will be written in csv format
random access files are printed sequentially if no rec num specified
 

Restore fileNum [, rec n]

repositions file pointer to bof
if pending print, data will be written before restore operation
if pending input, remaining input is ignored
