Release Notes for Version 0.3.0

September, 2023

This is the third beta release of the TI 99/4A Basic interpreter.
It runs using MicroPython 1.19.4 on the Raspberry Pico microprocessor.
It also runs on Windows using Python version 3.10.6.

This release implements many of the TI Extended Basic features
and much of the code was rewritten to minimize memory usage and speed execution on the RP2040.

Major differences between this interpreter and the original TI 99/4A Extended Basic:
1. Does not support TI function keys,
2.  Does not support TI graphics functions or colors,
3. Does not yet support sound functions,
4. No cassette interface,
5. Only one statement per line,
6. Disk file operations not yet supported.


Installation:
1. set up your Raspberry Pico or other RP2040 board with the latest version of MicroPython (see https://www.digikey.com/en/blog/quick-guide-to-rapid-prototyping-using-micropython).
2. Install a serial program such as Terra Term for Windows.
3. Connect the Pico to your computer using the USB cable then start Terra Term to determine which comm port to use.
4. Change the com port in file upload.bat to match your serial connection. 
5. Run upload.bat from a Windows console to upload the files.
6. Connect your terminal program to the Pico and press <Control> and <c> to start the interpreter.

Entering TI Basic code:
1. type NUMBER then enter your code. Each time you press the <Enter> key, the next line number will appear.
2. Press <Enter> to stop the auto-number feature.
3. Enter LIST to list your program.
4. Enter RUN to run your program.

To edit a line of code, retype the entier line.

Use the RESEQUENCE command to renumber the entire program.
